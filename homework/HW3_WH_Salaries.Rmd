title: "HW3 WH Salaries"
---

In this assignment, we will be working with a dataset containing information about the salaries of White House staffers as of July 2024.

### Task 1: Load the Tidyverse

You will need to load the tidyverse library

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

Then you'll load the data from the web. The URL for the data is: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwillis/jour405/refs/heads/main/data/biden_wh_salaries_2024.csv. You will create a dataframe called `wh_salaries` that contains the data from this URL.

### Task 2: Load the Data and Describe It

```{r}
wh_salaries <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwillis/jour405/refs/heads/main/data/biden_wh_salaries_2024.csv")
```
### Task 3: Describe the Data

You should examine that dataframe carefully by clicking on it in the Environment tab in RStudio. Write a couple of sentences describing the categories of incidents. From a reporting standpoint, what stands out to you about this data? Are there any salary values that will cause problems for analysis?

### Task 4: Calculate the Mean and Median of the Salaries

Write code to calculate the mean and median of the salaries in the dataset using the `summarize()` function. You don't need to make a new dataframe, just display the results.

```{r}
wh_salaries %>% 
  summarize(mean_salary = mean(salary), median_salary = median(salary))
```

### Task 5: Add in the minimum and maximum salaries

Take the code you just wrote and add in the minimum and maximum salaries (the functions for that are `min()` and `max()`). Your results should show four columns: mean_salary, median_salary, min_salary, max_salary.

```{r}
wh_salaries %>% 
  summarize(mean_salary = mean(salary), median_salary = median(salary), min_salary = min(salary), max_salary = max(salary))
```

### Task 6: Describe the Results

Write a couple of sentences describing the results of your analysis. What do the mean and median salaries tell you about the data? What do the minimum and maximum salaries tell you? Are there any outliers in the data?

The only main outlier in the data is the fact that there are some people who have a salary of zero. The mean and median salaries are somewhat similar, with the median salary being only $3,000 more than the mean salary.

### Task 7: Story Idea

Based on the data, what is your best story idea? What is the next step you would take to develop that story idea?

I feel like an interesting story idea would be the people who have no salary, who are these people and what do they do in the White House, are they staff volunteers? Another good story concept would be to also examine how the median and mean salaries have changed through different administrations.
