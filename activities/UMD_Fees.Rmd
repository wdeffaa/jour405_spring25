Follow along with the demo to learn how to calculate percentage change using R and the Tidyverse. You should get started by loading the tidyverse in a new R block.


### Task 1: Load the tidyverse

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

```


### Task 2: Load the UMD Fees dataset from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwillis/jour405/refs/heads/main/data/umd_fees.csv
```{r}
umd_fees <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwillis/jour405/refs/heads/main/data/umd_fees.csv")
```



### Task 3: Calculate the percentage change in each category between Fall 2024 and Fall 2021 using `mutate()`

```{r}
umd_fees_pct <- umd_fees %>% mutate(pct_change = (`Fall 2024`- `Fall 2021`)/`Fall 2021` *100)
```



### Task 4: Describe our results

Write a few sentences about what you found in the data. What's the story here?

Student fees have been increasing, with Student Sustainability showing the biggest growth. Student Sustainability fees have nearly doubled from Fall 2021 to Fall 2024, with an increase of 150%. In addition, shuttle bus fees have increased nearly 40 percent. While Student Athletic fees have seen no change since Fall 2021, that is likely to change with NIL coming into effect.



When you are done, save your work, switch to GitHub Desktop, then add, commit and push your changes to GitHub and submit the URL of the notebook in ELMS.
